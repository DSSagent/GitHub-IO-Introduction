#Hello I am Sebastian Mejia and I have 2 cats at home and live in NYC, Queens. I came from Academy of American Studies the highschool and took the subway to get there. I like to speedwalk and look at nature and learn. I played games like minecraft and persona and flight simulator but right now I am playing fire emblem and homework. I don't watch shows or movies but I do love cliff bars.
